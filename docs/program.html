    <br><dd><u>Title</u>: Quantifying and Communicating Uncertainty in Visual Data Analysis: Approaches and Challenges</dd> <br>
	<dd><u>Abstract</u>: Visualization is concerned with the analysis of collected data from measurements or of generated data from mathematical models. Hence, aleatoric (or data) uncertainty as well as epistemic (or model) uncertainty are inherently present in the analysis process. A trustworthy visual data analysis shall quantify and communicate the uncertainty during the visual data analysis approach. In this talk, challenges in estimating and conveying uncertainties will be identified and exemplified. Topics include ensemble approaches, statistical considerations, and machine-learning models.</dd><br>
    <br><dd><u>Bio</u>: Lars Linsen is a Full Professor of Computer Science at the University of Münster, Germany, where he is leading the Visualization and Graphics group (VISIX). He received his academic degrees in Computer Science from the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, including a Ph.D. degree in 2001. Further steps in his career include academic positions at the University of California, Davis, U.S.A., the University of Greifswald, Germany, and the Jacobs University, Bremen, Germany. His research interests are in scientific visualization, medical visualization, and multivariate data visualization, which include aspects of uncertainty visualization.</dd>
